# nu3 Platform (Gadget App Framework)

## Overview

**nu3 Platform** is an internal Gadget-based application framework designed to host and manage multiple required business apps for Shopify stores. It provides a unified environment for integrating and running various operational and compliance tools. The platform is built using Remix, Vite, and Shopify Polaris for a modern, embedded Shopify Admin experience.

**Best Before Notice Manager** is one of the included apps, automating the management of product best-before notices. The framework is designed to be extensible, allowing you to add and manage additional apps as business needs evolve.

## Features

- **App Framework**: Host and manage multiple business-critical apps within a single Gadget-based platform.
- **Best Before Notice Manager**: (Included app) Automatically identifies products nearing expiration using BigQuery, updates Akeneo PIM with localized best-before notices, and manages product categories (e.g., food saver).
- **PriceApi Sync**: (Included app) Syncs weekly market prices and competitor information from PriceAPI to BigQuery for LookerStudio dashboards.
- **Shopify Integration**: Embedded app with deep integration into Shopify Admin, supporting shop, sync, and GDPR request models.
- **Akeneo PIM Integration**: Fetches and updates product data, manages categories, and synchronizes best-before notices.
- **BigQuery Integration**: Queries product stock and expiration data to drive business logic.
- **Automated Logging**: All major actions and errors are logged and viewable in the app UI, with separate log sections for each app on the home dashboard.
- **GDPR Compliance**: Handles Shopify GDPR requests for shop data.

   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd gadget
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path-or-json-to-gcp-credentials
MAIL_ADDRESS_ERROR=your-error-email@example.com
MAILING_LIST=your-mailing-list@example.com

### Shopify App Configuration
- The app is configured as an embedded Shopify app. See `shopify.app.toml` for production settings.
- Required Shopify API scopes are set in `settings.gadget.ts`.

### Running the App
- **Development:**
  ```sh
  yarn shopify:dev
  ```
- **Build for Production:**

## Usage
- Access the platform from your Shopify Admin (must be installed as a Shopify embedded app).
- The main dashboard displays the included apps (e.g., Best Before Notice Manager, PriceApi Sync) and logs of recent actions.
- Logs for each app are shown in separate sections for easy monitoring and troubleshooting.
- All major actions (e.g., notice updates, errors) are logged and viewable in the UI.
- The framework is extensibleâ€”additional apps can be added as needed.

## Project Structure
- `api/` - Backend logic, integrations, and models
- `web/` - Frontend UI (Remix, Polaris, Gadget React)
- `accessControl/` - Permissions and access control
- `settings.gadget.ts` - App and plugin configuration
- `shopify.app.toml` - Shopify app settings

## Development
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled (`tsconfig.json`).
- Vite is used for fast builds and HMR (`vite.config.mts`).
- Custom UI components are in `web/components/`.
- Main business logic for best-before management is in `api/services/bestbeforenoticemanager.ts`.
- Main business logic for PriceApi Sync is in `api/services/priceapisyncmanager.ts`.
- Add new apps by extending the framework with additional modules and UI components.

## Logging & Troubleshooting
- All actions and errors are logged to the `logs` model and viewable in the app UI.
- The home dashboard displays logs for each app in separate sections.
