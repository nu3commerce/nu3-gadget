- `web/` - Frontend UI (Remix, Polaris, Gadget React)
- `accessControl/` - Permissions and access control
- `settings.gadget.ts` - App and plugin configuration
- `shopify.app.toml` - Shopify app settings

## Template Sync

The Template Sync feature allows you to synchronize Shopify templates between different stores. This is particularly useful for maintaining consistent product templates, collection templates, and other JSON templates across multiple Shopify stores.

### Features

- Select source shop and theme
- Browse and search templates from the source theme
- Select multiple templates to sync
- Select multiple target shops
- Automatic synchronization of required section files
- Automatic transfer of images used in templates
- Detailed error reporting and logging

### How It Works

1. **Select Source**: Choose the source shop and theme containing the templates you want to sync.
2. **Select Templates**: Browse and select the templates you want to synchronize.
3. **Select Targets**: Choose the target shops where you want to apply these templates.
4. **Sync**: Initiate the synchronization process.

The system will:
- Copy the selected templates to the target shops
- Ensure all required section files exist in the target themes
- Transfer any images referenced in the templates
- Log the results of the operation

### Technical Implementation

The Template Sync feature is implemented using the following components:

- **TemplateSyncManager**: A service that handles the synchronization logic
- **API Routes**: Endpoints for fetching themes and templates
- **UI Component**: A user-friendly interface for the sync operation

### Error Handling

The Template Sync feature includes robust error handling:

- If a section file is missing in the target theme, it will be copied from the source theme
- If a section file is missing in both source and target themes, the operation will continue but log a warning
- If an image is referenced in a template, it will be transferred to the target shop
- Any errors during the sync process are logged and displayed to the user

### Limitations

- Templates can only be synced between shops that are connected to the app
- The target theme must be the main (published) theme of the shop
- Large templates with many sections or images may take longer to sync

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Template Sync feature:

1. Check the logs on the dashboard for detailed error messages
2. Ensure all shops have the necessary API access
3. Verify that the templates exist in the source theme
4. Check that the target shops have a published theme

### Security

The Template Sync feature includes several security measures:

- Cross-shop data access prevention
- Session validation
- Shop ID validation
- Proper error handling to prevent information leakage

## PriceApi Sync

The PriceApi Sync feature automatically synchronizes weekly market prices and competitor information from PriceAPI to BigQuery for LookerStudio dashboards. This tool runs on a scheduled basis to keep pricing data up-to-date for business intelligence and competitive analysis.

AKENEO_CLIENT_SECRET=your-akeneo-client-secret
AKENEO_USERNAME=your-akeneo-username
AKENEO_PASSWORD=your-akeneo-password
```

### Country-Specific Rules

The system applies different rules for each country:

- **AT, CH, DE**: Products must be marked as "purchasable" in German locale
- **FR**: Products must be marked as "purchasable" in French locale
- **IT**: Products must be marked as "disabled" in Italian locale

### Data Flow

1. **Akeneo Query**: Fetches all third-party products from Akeneo PIM
2. **Country Filtering**: Applies country-specific purchasability filters
3. **EAN Collection**: Extracts EAN codes from eligible products
4. **Batch Creation**: Splits EANs into batches (configurable batch size)
5. **PriceAPI Jobs**: Submits bulk price lookup jobs to PriceAPI
6. **Result Polling**: Monitors job completion status
7. **Data Download**: Downloads CSV results from completed jobs
8. **BigQuery Insert**: Stores pricing data in country-specific BigQuery tables

### Monitoring and Logging

- All executions are logged to the Gadget logs model
- Success/failure status is tracked for each run
- Country-level error handling prevents single country failures from stopping the entire process
- Detailed error messages are captured for troubleshooting

### Troubleshooting
