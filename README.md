# nu3 Platform (Gadget App Framework)

## Overview

**nu3 Platform** is an internal Gadget-based application framework designed to host and manage multiple required business apps for Shopify stores. It provides a unified environment for integrating and running various operational and compliance tools. The platform is built using Remix, Vite, and Shopify Polaris for a modern, embedded Shopify Admin experience.

**Best Before Notice Manager** is one of the included apps, automating the management of product best-before notices. **Template Sync** is another included app that allows synchronization of Shopify templates between different stores. The framework is designed to be extensible, allowing you to add and manage additional apps as business needs evolve.

## Features

- **App Framework**: Host and manage multiple business-critical apps within a single Gadget-based platform.
- **Best Before Notice Manager**: (Included app) Automatically identifies products nearing expiration using BigQuery, updates Akeneo PIM with localized best-before notices, and manages product categories (e.g., food saver).
- **PriceApi Sync**: (Included app) Syncs weekly market prices and competitor information from PriceAPI to BigQuery for LookerStudio dashboards.
- **Template Sync**: (Included app) Synchronizes Shopify templates between different stores, including product templates, collection templates, and other JSON templates. Features automatic section file synchronization and image transfer.
- **Shopify Integration**: Embedded app with deep integration into Shopify Admin, supporting shop, sync, and GDPR request models.
- **Akeneo PIM Integration**: Fetches and updates product data, manages categories, and synchronizes best-before notices.
- **BigQuery Integration**: Queries product stock and expiration data to drive business logic.
- **Automated Logging**: All major actions and errors are logged and viewable in the app UI, with separate log sections for each app on the home dashboard.
- **GDPR Compliance**: Handles Shopify GDPR requests for shop data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- Yarn (v1)
- Access to required environment variables (see below)
- Access to Gadget, Shopify Partner, Akeneo, and Google Cloud accounts

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd gadget
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path-or-json-to-gcp-credentials
MAIL_ADDRESS_ERROR=your-error-email@example.com
MAILING_LIST=your-mailing-list@example.com
BIGQUERY_TABLE=your-bigquery-table
AKENEO_BASE_URL=https://your-akeneo-instance.com
AKENEO_CLIENT_ID=your-akeneo-client-id
AKENEO_CLIENT_SECRET=your-akeneo-client-secret
AKENEO_USERNAME=your-akeneo-username
AKENEO_PASSWORD=your-akeneo-password
PRICE_API_TOKEN=your-priceapi-token
```

### Shopify App Configuration
- The app is configured as an embedded Shopify app. See `shopify.app.toml` for production settings.
- Required Shopify API scopes are set in `settings.gadget.ts`.

### Running the App
- **Development:**
  ```sh
  yarn shopify:dev
  ```
- **Build for Production:**
  ```sh
  yarn build
  ```
- **Deploy to Shopify:**
  ```sh
  yarn shopify:deploy
  ```

## Usage
- Access the platform from your Shopify Admin (must be installed as a Shopify embedded app).
- The main dashboard displays the included apps (e.g., Best Before Notice Manager, PriceApi Sync) and logs of recent actions.
- Logs for each app are shown in separate sections for easy monitoring and troubleshooting.
- All major actions (e.g., notice updates, errors) are logged and viewable in the UI.
- The framework is extensibleâ€”additional apps can be added as needed.

## Project Structure
- `api/` - Backend logic, integrations, and models
- `web/` - Frontend UI (Remix, Polaris, Gadget React)
- `accessControl/` - Permissions and access control
- `settings.gadget.ts` - App and plugin configuration
- `shopify.app.toml` - Shopify app settings

## Template Sync

The Template Sync feature allows you to synchronize Shopify templates between different stores. This is particularly useful for maintaining consistent product templates, collection templates, and other JSON templates across multiple Shopify stores.

### Features

- Select source shop and theme
- Browse and search templates from the source theme
- Select multiple templates to sync
- Select multiple target shops
- Automatic synchronization of required section files
- Automatic transfer of images used in templates
- Detailed error reporting and logging

### How It Works

1. **Select Source**: Choose the source shop and theme containing the templates you want to sync.
2. **Select Templates**: Browse and select the templates you want to synchronize.
3. **Select Targets**: Choose the target shops where you want to apply these templates.
4. **Sync**: Initiate the synchronization process.

The system will:
- Copy the selected templates to the target shops
- Ensure all required section files exist in the target themes
- Transfer any images referenced in the templates
- Log the results of the operation

### Technical Implementation

The Template Sync feature is implemented using the following components:

- **TemplateSyncManager**: A service that handles the synchronization logic
- **API Routes**: Endpoints for fetching themes and templates
- **UI Component**: A user-friendly interface for the sync operation

### Error Handling

The Template Sync feature includes robust error handling:

- If a section file is missing in the target theme, it will be copied from the source theme
- If a section file is missing in both source and target themes, the operation will continue but log a warning
- If an image is referenced in a template, it will be transferred to the target shop
- Any errors during the sync process are logged and displayed to the user

### Limitations

- Templates can only be synced between shops that are connected to the app
- The target theme must be the main (published) theme of the shop
- Large templates with many sections or images may take longer to sync

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Template Sync feature:

1. Check the logs on the dashboard for detailed error messages
2. Ensure all shops have the necessary API access
3. Verify that the templates exist in the source theme
4. Check that the target shops have a published theme

### Security

The Template Sync feature includes several security measures:

- Cross-shop data access prevention
- Session validation
- Shop ID validation
- Proper error handling to prevent information leakage

## Development
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled (`tsconfig.json`).
- Vite is used for fast builds and HMR (`vite.config.mts`).
- Custom UI components are in `web/components/`.
- Main business logic for best-before management is in `api/services/bestbeforenoticemanager.ts`.
- Main business logic for PriceApi Sync is in `api/services/priceapisyncmanager.ts`.
- Add new apps by extending the framework with additional modules and UI components.

## Logging & Troubleshooting
- All actions and errors are logged to the `logs` model and viewable in the app UI.
- The home dashboard displays logs for each app in separate sections.
- For API reference, see [Gadget API docs](https://docs.gadget.dev/api/nu3).
